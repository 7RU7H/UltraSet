# UltraStrategy

- Time and timings
- Preparation is everything
- End game is everything
- Information - The map is not the territory, but maps are everything (Markov Chains and Graph theory)
	- All systems can reduced to abstract representation
	- Culture
	- Patterns
	- Inventory (management)
- Everything is a Weapon
- Adaptability

- Always do something different
- Know your mark
- Defy Expectation
- Formlessness
- Improvisation
- Subvert everything
- Dependencies?
- Strategy is self-and perspective on the external
	- how's you recon,
	- planning, 
	- logistics
	- intelligence 
	- team play
	- information inventory and visibility over all the past, present and future
- Discipline and focus replaces moral
- Strategy is non-formulaic and is not problem solving or tactics which are formulaic
- Play correctly for the current context

- Belief is the death of intelligence, never believe yours or anyone else's bullshit and always update yourself of the actualities of the current real.
