# Ultra Learning 


# Draft jibberish - collect notes and references


Mastery comes from learning to accept that you must only want to expand on the fundamentals of the subject, not in the egotism of future - you will be happy and learn faster and never give up 
as it is just like when a child learns to communicate - you learn to do not because of high order personal, societal reasons - flow with the universe and not to twist the universe into your image.



Humility and humbleness to accept failure and rejoice in failure as reminder of your lack to then gain insight and improve

Admire, embrace and love others people ingenuity, everyone else is better than you - the only way to get better is to learn from everyone else.
 

Openness, curiosity and playfulness, in questioning everything - not arrogance to assume or to question without the intention of learning answers that you dislike 


Participating in the target subject everyday 
- Do something
- Ask questions
- Make maps from notes to reference and memorise
- Research something 
- Read something: learn the terminology, conceptual domains, schools of thought 

- If you succeed, learn how others succeeded in a different way and think about how in a different problem that solution could be used
- If you fail, fail gracefully to succeed in learning
    - Do not waste time learn why you were wrong 
    - Translate the solution from (python to golang)
    - Extract what knowledge or understanding you originally needed as a reusable component and use in the next problem  

- If you copy something you must make it your own in a differing context and test and tweak it to understand why you would want to copy it, if you do not want to do that then do not copy it and note the concept and reference the source 


Anchor Bias

Back To Basics

Focus
Developing Focus
Appreciating Rest as a value

Quantity for living in the information, Quality for emboding what you need


Memorization
Practice
Modelling
Evaluation

- Failure only in Memorization and Practicing no teacher no Correction of M or E
+ Understanding
- Creativity


Meta-learning
Focus
Directness
Drill
Retrieval
Feedback
Retention
Intuition
Experimentation

Incomplete problem strategy taps into the "generation effect," a phenomenon in which learners better remember information they generate themselves.
Scaffolding and Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Teaching




Error Correction
- Reading
- Comprehension
- Self Measuring potential responses
- Writing responses
