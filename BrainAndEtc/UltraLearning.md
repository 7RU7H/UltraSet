# Ultra Learning 

Exercise: 
- Increase your ability to take in new information, by chemical hacking your brain to learning 15% more effectively (also improves mental health, sleep schedules - the first thing a mental health profession will check if you are ill or heading toward being unwell is how much exercise you do). 
	- [(Warner, 2006)](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20061103/exercise-fights-fatigue-boosts-energy) - Exercise improves almost everything
	- [(Rodriguez, 2015)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hit-the-gym-after-studying-to-boost-recall/) - Exercise after study to boost recall

Personality and Environment
- Be humble 
- Be curious
- Be confident in not making errors, by practising - see Error section  
- Get mentors, no solo
- Pick a good place to learn that is your learning spot
- Reward yourself for an amount of time learning
- Practice focusing till you can for 2 hours, practice disengaging to reduce mistakes
- Spaced Learning - [(Pan, 2022)](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/effective-studying/spaced-practice.html)

Objectives:
1. Improve the quality of information we take in
	- Check you understood what you read
	- Listen to listen, don't listen to respond
	- Good Note taking, Flashcards, etc are subjectively made, but quality is empirical
2. Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
	- Learn by doing, remember by doing
	- Follow along and practice with a master 
3. Improve our practice of retrieving information
	- Create a model what you are learn
	- Retrieval Practice - Quizzes, partial-closed book challenges 
4. Improve upon self-discipline and methodology of self-critique to find flaws and schedule a solution to improve on that flaw  
	- Write one page essays, cheatsheets, etc (partial) closed book

Concepts:
- Cognitive Load - Too much information at once
- [Contextualised Learning](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED448304.pdf) - it is easier to learn something if you are contextualising it with practice
- [Transversal Skills Lopez and Rodriguez-Lopez, 2020)](https://ervet-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40461-020-00100-0](https://ervet-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40461-020-00100-0) 
	- Focus on understanding:
		- Methodology
		- Techniques
		- Purpose of actions
- Demonstrative Method - modelling what is intended to be learnt 
	- Re-enforce verification of our work - Science!  
- [Interleaving](https://academicaffairs.arizona.edu/l2l-strategy-interleaving) - learning in context one task to for example exploit a system may actually help one understand how to detect it
- Priming - briefing your brain with information of something that is upcoming have memories to reference and instantiate 
- Modelling - map out material to be learnt in model of context
- SQ3R and PQ4R methods 
	- Survey, question, read, recite and review
	- Preview, question, read, reflect, recite and review - [good for reading comprehension](https://www.verywellfamily.com/strategy-improves-reading-comprehension-2162266)
- Feynman Technique 
	1.  Learn a X
	2.  Explain it to a beginner
	3.  Identify gaps
	4.  Return to study

Participating in the target subject everyday 
- Do something
- Ask questions
- Make maps from notes to reference and memorise
- Research something 
- Read something: learn the terminology, conceptual domains, schools of thought 

- If you succeed, learn how others succeeded in a different way and think about how in a different problem that solution could be used
- If you fail, fail gracefully to succeed in learning
    - Do not waste time learn why you were wrong 
    - Translate the solution from (python to golang)
    - Extract what knowledge or understanding you originally needed as a reusable component and use in the next problem  

- If you copy something you must make it your own in a differing context and test and tweak it to understand why you would want to copy it, if you do not want to do that then do not copy it and note the concept and reference the source 


Incomplete problem strategy taps into the "generation effect," a phenomenon in which learners better remember information they generate themselves.
- Scaffolding and Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Teaching

Develop Habits to Avoid Errors:
- Study errors in your exam papers
	- Look for your own carelessness
	- Careless is a sizeable percentage of incorrect answers
- Think of habits to avoid those errors
	- Draw bigger diagrams (or in different locations) - Workspace mobility 
	- Complete each action - Order of Operations
	- Don't do so much in your head - Noting 
	- Use headings and set your work out clearly - Noting 
	- Write formulae before substituting - Order of Operations
	- Re-read questions after you have answered them - Locate the obvious mistakes
	- Solve some problems in one big equation - Start with everything - miss nothing
- Develop procedural habits for answering questions
- Practise your improved habits until they are ingrained
